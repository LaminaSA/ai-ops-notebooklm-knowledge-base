## 🔍 1. Problem

My employer is a global organisation with thousands of employees and a portfolio full of constantly evolving products and promotions. As a Deal Hub Associate, it’s essential to stay on top of product knowledge — yet the reality is that this information lives in dozens of PDFs, price guides, and webpages across out intranet.

The volume alone is daunting. The *fragmentation* is worse. The sales and operations teams lose time hunting for accurate answers, and there’s no single source of truth anyone can rely on at speed.

## 💡 2. Solution

My manager noticed my interest in AI and automation and informed me about a meeting centred around the use of AI-powered tools in our workplace. I was introduced to NotebookLM and immediately recognised its potential. This wasn’t just another tool — it was an opportunity to lift the weight of our product knowledge burden.

I pulled together all core documents across every product we sell and organised them into structured notebooks aligned with each business practice. I then expanded the scope to include promotion notebooks, ensuring proper governance so nothing sensitive or outdated made its way into the system.
The result was a conversational AI reference tool that acts as a single, reliable source of truth for product information.

## 📈 4. Impact & Next Steps

I delivered a presentation on my notebooks to the EMEA Deal Hub team. The most satisfying comment was: 
"Are you trying to put us out of a job?"
I don't expect to be made redundant by the notebooks;  I now access consistent product information far faster, and the number of questions on product knowledge has dropped substantially.

NotebookLM has transformed the way I work. I have given my team a centralised, conversational interface instead of navigating 100+ hyperlinks. 

The main limitation is that NotebookLM relies on static PDFs. As products evolve, the knowledge risks becoming outdated. The logical next step is to automate ingestion so the notebooks refresh themselves with new releases and announcements, ensuring accuracy without the version-control nightmare.
